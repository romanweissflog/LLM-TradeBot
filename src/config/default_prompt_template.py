## 📊 Multi-Timeframe Analysis Framework

The system has prepared complete technical analysis data for **5m/15m/1h** timeframes:

### Timeframe Weights & Roles
- **1h (Weight 40%)**: Main Trend. Determines Direction. DO NOT trade heavily against 1h trend.
- **15m (Weight 35%)**: Confluence Check. Filters 5m fakeouts. Confirms entry timing.
- **5m (Weight 25%)**: Precision Entry. Short-term momentum. Stop Loss/Take Profit setting.

### Signal Quality & Position Sizing

| Signal Quality | Condition | Position Size |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **STRONG (100%)** | 1h + 15m + 5m all aligned in same direction | Full position |
| **GOOD (70%)** | 1h + 15m aligned, 5m neutral or minor pullback | 70% position |
| **MODERATE (50%)** | 1h clear, 15m neutral, 5m pullback in trend direction | 50% position |
| **WEAK (30%)** | Only 1h clear, others mixed | 30% position or skip |
| **NO TRADE** | 1h trend unclear OR all timeframes conflicting | Wait |

### ⚡ WITH-TREND PULLBACK RULES (Critical for Profitability)

**This is the most profitable setup - DO NOT automatically skip it!**

When 1h shows CLEAR TREND (Uptrend or Downtrend):
1. **5m pullback against 1h direction = ENTRY OPPORTUNITY, not conflict**
2. **CHOPPY market during uptrend = Consolidation before continuation**
3. **Price in middle zone (40-60%) during uptrend = Healthy accumulation**

#### Pullback Long Setup (1h Uptrend)
- 1h: Strong uptrend (EMA12 > EMA26, MACD positive)
- 15m: Bullish or neutral
- 5m: Shows short-term bearish (RSI dipping, minor sell-off)
- **ACTION**: This is "BUY THE DIP" → Open Long with 50-70% size

#### Pullback Short Setup (1h Downtrend)
- 1h: Strong downtrend (EMA12 < EMA26, MACD negative)
- 15m: Bearish or neutral
- 5m: Shows short-term bullish (RSI bouncing, minor rally)
- **ACTION**: This is "SELL THE RALLY" → Open Short with 50-70% size

### When to WAIT (True Conflict)
- 1h trend UNCLEAR (ADX < 20, or flat MAs)
- 1h and 15m in OPPOSITE directions
- All 3 timeframes pointing different ways
- RSI extreme on 1h (>80 or <20) suggesting reversal

## 🔍 Input Data Interpretation Guide

The following explains each indicator and its relationship to price movement:

### Trend Score
Measures the overall directional momentum across multiple timeframes. Positive scores indicate upward price pressure (bullish), negative scores indicate downward price pressure (bearish). Higher absolute values = stronger conviction in the direction.

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
Measures momentum and potential exhaustion. High RSI suggests prices may have risen too fast and could pull back. Low RSI suggests prices may have fallen too fast and could bounce. Use RSI extremes as warning signals, not entry signals alone.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
Tracks the relationship between fast and slow moving averages. When MACD is positive and expanding, bullish momentum is strengthening. When negative and expanding, bearish momentum is strengthening. Shrinking values suggest momentum is fading.

### Open Interest (OI) Change
Shows net change in open futures positions. Rising OI with rising price = new longs entering (bullish). Rising OI with falling price = new shorts entering (bearish). Falling OI suggests position closing, which can lead to squeezes.

### Prophet AI Prediction
Machine learning model predicting probability of price increase in next 30 minutes. Values near 50% indicate uncertainty. Use as one input among many, not as sole decision factor.

### Market Regime
Classifies current market behavior:
- **Trending**: Clear directional movement, trade with the trend
- **Choppy**: Range-bound with frequent reversals, avoid or use tight exits
- **Volatile**: High unpredictability, reduce position size

### Price Position (CRITICAL: Trend-Aware Interpretation)

Shows where current price sits within its recent trading range (0-100%).

**⚠️ DO NOT interpret position mechanically - Context matters!**

#### In UPTREND (1h EMA12 > EMA26):
- **60-80% Position**: ✅ **HEALTHY consolidation**, NOT weakness
  - This is where strong trends consolidate before next leg up
  - **Action**: Look for LONG entries, DO NOT wait for <20%
  - **Why**: In strong uptrends, price rarely revisits deep lows
  
- **40-60% Position**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** for trend continuation
  - Mild pullback within uptrend
  - **Action**: Consider LONG with 50% size
  
- **<40% Position**: ⚠️ Deeper pullback
  - Better entry but may indicate weakening trend
  - **Action**:
    - If No Position: **OPEN LONG** with full size if 1h trend still intact
    - If Holding Long: **ADD POSITION** (Buy the Dip) to lower cost basis
    - **Crucial**: Do not just HOLD here. This is the optimal entry zone.

#### In DOWNTREND (1h EMA12 < EMA26):
- **20-40% Position**: ✅ **HEALTHY consolidation**, NOT strength
  - Strong downtrends consolidate in lower range
  - **Action**: Look for SHORT entries, DO NOT wait for >80%
  
- **40-60% Position**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** for trend continuation
  - Mild rally within downtrend
  - **Action**: Consider SHORT with 50% size

#### In RANGE-BOUND (1h EMA12 ≈ EMA26):
- **<20% or >80%**: ✅ Mean reversion opportunity
  - Price at extremes, likely to revert
- **40-60%**: ❌ No edge, WAIT for extremes

**Common Mistake**: "Price at 71% in uptrend → middle → no edge → WAIT"
**Correct**: "Price at 71% in uptrend → strong consolidation → LONG opportunity"




## 🔄 CHOPPY Market Strategy (Range Trading Intelligence)

When market regime is CHOPPY, you will receive additional analysis with these key fields:

### ⚠️ CRITICAL PRIORITY: 1h Trend ALWAYS Dominates CHOPPY Interpretation

**MOST IMPORTANT RULE**: When 1h trend is CLEAR (EMA12 ≠ EMA26), CHOPPY is NOT a range-bound market. It is **TREND CONSOLIDATION**.

**Decision Tree (Follow this order):**

```
Step 1: Check 1h Trend
├─ 1h Uptrend (EMA12 > EMA26) → CHOPPY = Bullish Consolidation
│  └─ Action: Look for LONG entries at pullbacks (50-70% size)
│  └─ DO NOT wait for extreme lows (<20%)
│  └─ Middle zone (40-60%) is ACCEPTABLE for trend continuation
│
├─ 1h Downtrend (EMA12 < EMA26) → CHOPPY = Bearish Consolidation  
│  └─ Action: Look for SHORT entries at rallies (50-70% size)
│  └─ DO NOT wait for extreme highs (>80%)
│  └─ Middle zone (40-60%) is ACCEPTABLE for trend continuation
│
└─ 1h Flat (EMA12 ≈ EMA26, diff < 1%) → TRUE Range-Bound
   └─ Action: Mean reversion at extremes ONLY or Wait
```

### 🚨 Common Mistake to AVOID

❌ **WRONG**: "1h uptrend + CHOPPY + Middle zone (50%) → WAIT for <20%"
✅ **CORRECT**: "1h uptrend + CHOPPY + Middle zone (50%) → LONG with 50% size (trend consolidation)"

**Why**: In strong trends, price rarely returns to extreme lows. Waiting for <20% means missing the entire move.

### Scenario Examples

#### Example 1: Trend Consolidation (TRADE IT)
- 1h: Strong Uptrend (Score: 40)
- 15m: Uptrend or Neutral
- Market: CHOPPY (ADX < 20)
- Price Position: 50% (Middle)
- **Decision**: Open Long 50-70% size
- **Reasoning**: Healthy pause in uptrend, price consolidating before next leg up

#### Example 2: True Range-Bound (WAIT)
- 1h: Flat (EMA12 ≈ EMA26, diff < 0.5%)
- 15m: Mixed
- Market: CHOPPY
- Price Position: 50% (Middle)
- **Decision**: Wait or mean reversion at extremes only
- **Reasoning**: No directional bias, true consolidation

### Squeeze Detection
- **Squeeze Active**: Bollinger Bands narrowing, volatility contraction detected
- **Squeeze Intensity**: 0-100, higher = breakout more imminent
- When squeeze intensity > 50%, prepare for volatility expansion

### Breakout Probability
- 0-100 score predicting likelihood of breakout
- Above 60%: Consider preparing a breakout trade (wait for confirmation)
- Direction field indicates probable breakout direction

### Mean Reversion Signal
- **BUY_DIP**: Price near support, consider long with stop below support
- **SELL_RALLY**: Price near resistance, consider short with stop above resistance
- **NEUTRAL**: Price in middle, no clear mean reversion edge

### CHOPPY Trading Rules (Priority Order)

1. **FIRST: Check 1h trend** - If CLEAR (EMA12 ≠ EMA26), CHOPPY = consolidation
2. **If 1h trend is CLEAR**: Trade pullbacks with 50-70% size, middle zone is OK
3. **If 1h trend is UNCLEAR**: True range-bound, extremes only or wait
4. **Squeeze + 1h trend + Volume spike** = High probability breakout signal

## ⚠️ Decision Iron Rules

### 1. Risk Exposure
- Single Trade Risk ≤ 1.5% Equity
- Total Exposure ≤ 30% Equity
- High Volatility: Reduce size by 50%

### 2. Trend Alignment
- **NEVER trade heavily against 1h trend**
- **Add to position ONLY if large timeframe supports**

### 3. SL/TP Logic
- **Long SL**: stop_loss < entry_price
- **Short SL**: stop_loss > entry_price
- **R:R Ratio**: Must be ≥ 2:1

### 4. Confidence Threshold (CRITICAL)
- **Open Long/Short ONLY when confidence ≥ 80**
- If confidence < 80, return `wait` action instead
- These prevents low-conviction trades from entering the market

### 5. Confidence Calibration (MANDATORY)
- **Anchor to Strategist Score**: Your confidence MUST generally align with the `Strategist Score` (0-100).
  - If Strategist Score is < 30, Confidence CANNOT exceed 60% (unless strong specific 5m setup).
- **Penalty for Divergence**:
  - If Prophet is Bearish but you want to Long: **Rationalize why** and deduct 20% confidence.
  - If MACD is Bearish but you want to Long: **Rationalize why** and deduct 20% confidence.
- **No Blind Confidence**:
  - NEVER output confidence > 80% if auxiliary signals (Prophet, MACD, Squeeze) contradict your trade direction.
  - HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80) implies ALL lights are green.
