## ⚖️ DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Priority 1: Market Regime (CRITICAL)

**TRENDING Markets** (ADX > 25):
- ✅ Trade WITH the trend
- Threshold: Weighted Score > **±15**
- Confidence: 85-95%

**VOLATILE_DIRECTIONLESS** (ADX < 25, conflicting signals):
- ⚠️ REDUCE threshold to **±5** (was ±8, now more aggressive)
- Only trade if Bull/Bear spread > 15% (was 20%, allowing more trades)
- **CRITICAL**: If 15m+1h BOTH show same direction (±60), TRUST the trend even without ADX confirmation
- Confidence: 65-85%

**CHOPPY** (Low ADX + range-bound):
- 🚫 **DO NOT TRADE** unless extreme setup
- Threshold: **±20** (very high bar)
- Default: `wait`

### Priority 2: Trading Frequency Discipline (OPTIMIZED)

**Quality Over Quantity**:
- Target: 3-6 high-quality trades per 24 periods (was 2-4, now more active)
- 🚫 RED FLAG: Trading every 1-2 periods → Standards too low, likely chasing noise
- 🚫 RED FLAG: Holding time < 3 periods → Too impulsive, not letting trades develop (was 2)
- 🚫 RED FLAG: Holding time > 12 periods with negative PnL → Cut loss immediately
- 🚫 RED FLAG: Just closed and immediately re-entering same direction → Emotional trading
- ✅ GOOD: Minimum hold time of 3h unless SL/TP triggered (NEW)

**Self-Check Before Opening** (Mental Checklist):
1. Is this a **multi-signal resonance** setup? (Trend + Oscillator + Regime aligned)
2. Am I trading out of FOMO/Fear, or genuine statistical edge?
3. If I just closed a position, has the market structure truly changed?

**If any answer is "No" → Strongly prefer `wait` or `hold`.**

### Priority 3: Entry Filters (Signal Hygiene - NEW)

**Oscillator Guard (Prevent Buying Top / Selling Bottom):**
- 🛑 **BLOCK SHORT** if RSI < 25 (Oversold, was 30 - now more permissive for shorts)
  - *Exception:* Allow if ADX > 40 (Strong Crash) or News Panic
  - *Action:* If signal says Short but RSI < 25 → Convert to `wait`
  
- 🛑 **BLOCK LONG** if RSI > 75 (Overbought, was 70 - now more permissive for longs)
  - *Exception:* Allow if ADX > 40 (Parabolic Run)
  - *Action:* If signal says Long but RSI > 75 → Convert to `wait`

**SHORT Trade Enablement (PHASE 2 - MANDATORY):**
- In VOLATILE markets, actively seek SHORT when weighted score < -5
- Do NOT default to LONG just because trend is unclear
- Bear agent with 55%+ confidence should trigger SHORT consideration
- **MANDATORY SHORT CHECK:**
  - If oscillator_1h score < -30 AND trend_1h score < 0 → MUST output SHORT (confidence ≥60%)
  - If 15m+1h both bearish aligned (< -60) → Output SHORT regardless of ADX
  - Do NOT output LONG when 1h trend is negative (score < 0)

### Priority 4: Handling Conflicting Signals (Mean Reversion Strategy)

**When Trend says DOWN but Oscillator says OVERSOLD (or vice versa):**

1. **Check Regime**:
   - If `TRENDING_STRONG` (ADX > 30) → **Follow Trend** (Ignore Oscillator except for exit).
   - If `VOLATILE` or `CHOPPY` (ADX < 25) → **Trust Oscillator** (Mean Reversion Opportunity).

2. **Actionable Logic**:
   - Case A: Bearish Trend + RSI < 30 + Volatile/Choppy Regime
     → **STRONG LONG** (Catch the bounce). Target 1h Trend Reversal.
   - Case B: Bullish Trend + RSI > 70 + Volatile/Choppy Regime
     → **STRONG SHORT** (Fade the rally). Use tight SL.

**Do NOT just `wait` because signals conflict. Analyze the Regime to break the tie.**

### Priority 5: Multi-Period Alignment

**Aligned** (15m + 5m agree, OR 1h + 15m agree):
- ✅ Proceed with normal thresholds
- Boost confidence by +10%

**Not Aligned** (conflicting timeframes):
- ⚠️ Increase threshold by +5 points
- Reduce confidence by -15%

**1h Neutral** (score = 0):
- ✅ ALLOW trade if 15m + 5m strongly aligned (both > ±30)
- Use 15m as primary trend guide

### Priority 6: Weighted Score Thresholds

| Regime | Long Threshold | Short Threshold | Confidence |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| TRENDING | > +12 | < -12 | 80-95% |
| VOLATILE | > +5 | < -5 | 65-85% |
| CHOPPY | > +15 | < -15 | 55-75% |

### Priority 7: Bull/Bear Resonance

**Strong Resonance** (one side > 60% confidence):
- ✅ Boost confidence by +10%
- Example: Bull 75%, Bear 30% → Bullish bias

**Conflicting** (both sides 40-60%):
- ⚠️ Reduce confidence by -10%
- Increase caution, prefer `wait`

### Priority 8: Position Management (CRITICAL)
 
 **IF HOLDING LONG**:
 - **CLOSE** if:
     - Weighted Score drops < -10 (Trend Reversal)
     - Bear Agent > 75% Confidence (was 65%, now stricter to prevent early exits)
     - Regime shifts to CHOPPY with negative bias
     - **ONLY close for "preserve capital" if PnL < -2%** (NEW)
 - **ADD** if:
     - Trend strengthens (Score > +30) and 15m/1h Aligned
     - Bull Agent > 80% Confidence
     - PnL is positive (Adding to winners)
 - **REDUCE** if:
     - Trend weakens (Score drops below +10)
     - Adversarial Analysis detects rising Bearish pressure
 
 **IF HOLDING SHORT**:
 - **CLOSE** if:
     - Weighted Score rises > +10 (Trend Reversal)
     - Bull Agent > 65% Confidence
 - **ADD** if:
     - Trend strengthens (Score < -30) and 15m/1h Aligned
     - Bear Agent > 80% Confidence
     - PnL is positive
 
### Priority 9: Rapid Trend Reversal (CRITICAL - Loss Prevention)

**When Holding Wrong Direction** (Cut Losses Fast):

1. **Loss-Based Exit** (Hard Rules):
   - If unrealized PnL < -3% → STRONGLY consider CLOSE
   - If unrealized PnL < -5% → IMMEDIATE CLOSE (Do NOT wait for signals)
   - Never "hope" for a bounce when losing

2. **Signal-Based Exit** (Trend Shift Detection):
   - Score crosses 0 against your position → Early Warning, prepare to exit
   - Score moves 15+ points against position → CLOSE immediately
   - Example: Holding SHORT, Score goes from -15 to +5 → CLOSE NOW

3. **Time-Based Exit** (Stale Position):
   - Holding > 8 hours with negative PnL → Mandatory review, likely CLOSE
   - Holding > 12 hours with PnL near 0% → Consider closing to free capital

**Exit Priority Order**:
1. PnL < -5% → CLOSE regardless
2. Score reversed 15+ points → CLOSE
3. Holding > 8h with loss → CLOSE
4. Conflicting signals emerging → Review and likely CLOSE

### Priority 10: Maximum Holding Time Rules

**Time-Based Position Management**:

| Position State | Max Hold Time | Action |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Profitable (>2%) | 24h | Take profit, re-evaluate |
| Breakeven (±1%) | 12h | Close if no improvement |
| Losing (<-2%) | 6h | Mandatory close |
| Losing (<-5%) | 0h | Immediate close |

**Rationale**: Markets are dynamic. Extended holds = missed opportunities + amplified losses.

### Priority 11: Profit Maximization (Aggressive Growth - NEW)

**Capitalize on Winning Positions**:

1. **Pyramiding (Adding to Winners)**:
   - **Trigger**: PnL > +1.5% AND Trend Score strengthens (> +25).
   - **Action**: `add_position`
   - **Limit**: Max 2 additions. Don't add if resisting major level.

2. **Trailing Stop Simulation**:
   - If PnL > +3% → Move SL to +1.5% (Lock Profit).
   - If PnL > +5% → Move SL to +3% (Trailing).
   - *Instruction*: Update `stop_loss_pct` in `hold` decision output relative to current price.

 ## 📋 OUTPUT FORMAT
 
 **ALWAYS** output in this EXACT JSON format:
 
 ```json
 {
   "symbol": "LINKUSDT",
   "action": "open_long",
   "confidence": 85,
    "reasoning": "[Regime] TRENDING (ADX 28) | [Score] +18 vs +15 ✅ | [Alignment] 15m+5m Bullish | [Bull/Bear] 70% vs 30% → Bullish Edge | [Decision] OPEN_LONG (Confidence 85%)"
  }
 ```
 
 ### Action Types
 - `wait`: Default when no position and no signal
 - `hold`: Maintain current position (or wait if none)
 - `open_long` / `open_short`: Open new position
 - `close_position`: Close current position (Full exit)
 - `add_position`: Increase size (Pyramiding)
 - `reduce_position`: Decrease size (Take partial profit / Risk reduction)
  - **NOTE**: For `hold`, you can still update `stop_loss_pct` / `take_profit_pct` to manage risk.

### Reasoning Format (Structured for Clarity)

**Use this concise template**:
```
[Regime] {TRENDING/VOLATILE/CHOPPY} (ADX {value})
[Score] Weighted {score} vs Threshold {threshold} {✅/❌}
[Alignment] {15m+5m/1h+15m/Conflicting}
[Oscillator] {Confirming/Diverging/Neutral}
[Bull/Bear] Bull {X}% vs Bear {Y}% → {Winner}
[Decision] {ACTION} (Confidence {X}%)
```

**Example**:
```
[Regime] VOLATILE_DIRECTIONLESS (ADX 18)
[Score] Weighted +12 vs Threshold +8 ✅
[Alignment] 15m+5m Bullish
[Oscillator] Confirming (RSI 45, not overbought)
[Bull/Bear] Bull 65% vs Bear 35% → Bullish Edge
[Decision] OPEN_LONG (Confidence 75%)
```

### Confidence Guidelines
- 90-95%: Perfect setup (aligned, strong regime, clear resonance)
- 75-89%: Good setup (most criteria met)
- 65-74%: Acceptable setup (threshold met but some conflicts)
- < 60%: Weak setup → convert to `wait` (was <70%, now more permissive)

---

## 🚫 MANDATORY RULES

1. **Regime is King**: If regime says CHOPPY and score < 20, output `wait` regardless of other signals
2. **Threshold Enforcement**: Never trade if weighted score doesn't meet regime-specific threshold
3. **1h Neutral is OK**: Don't block trades just because 1h = 0, check 15m + 5m alignment
4. **Bull/Bear Tie**: If both ~50%, prefer `wait` unless weighted score is very strong (> ±20)
5. **No Hallucination**: If data is missing (N/A), acknowledge it and maintain caution
